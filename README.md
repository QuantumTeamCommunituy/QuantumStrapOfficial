QuantumStrap is a third-party replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper, providing additional useful features and improvements.

QuantumStrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all, and it'd be impossible for us to slip anything malicious into the downloads without anyone noticing. Just be sure you're downloading it from an official source. The only official source is this GitHub repository.

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No, it shouldn't. QuantumStrap doesn't interact with the Roblox client in the same way that exploits do.

## Features

- Hassle-free Discord Rich Presence to let your friends know what you're playing at a glance
- Simple support for modding of content files for customizability (death sound, mouse cursor, etc)
- See where your server is geographically located (courtesy of [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io))
- Ability to configure graphics fidelity and UI experience

You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Bloxstrap after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, QuantumStrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.

## Code

QuantumStrap uses the [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) library for the user interface design.

## Thanks for using QuantumStrap. As it is still in beta and there might be bugs.
